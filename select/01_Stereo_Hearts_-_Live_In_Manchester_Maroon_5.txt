My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, whoa-oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you handle that?
The truth is, the truth, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
'Cause the last girl that left me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
I keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you, yeah
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, whoa-oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (to my stereo) "Come on"
Oh, oh-oh, oh, just sing along to my stereo (let's go)
If I was an old-school, fifty pound boom box
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
And would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And turn it higher every time they told you to stop?
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mix tape your friends make
You never know what's come and go, like on the interstate
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
My heart's a stereo that only plays for you, yeah
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, whoa-oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (to my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, just sing along to my stereo
I only pray you'll never leave me behind
'Cause good music can be so hard to find
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine
Thought love was dead, now you're changing my mind
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, whoa-oh, yeah
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (to my stereo)
Oh, oh-oh, oh, just sing along to my stereo
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh (to my stereo) "Come on!"
Oh, oh-oh, oh, just sing along to my stereo
